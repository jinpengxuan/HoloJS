        <h1>HoloJs Overview</h1>
        <h3>What is HoloJs</h3>
        HoloJS is an execution host for Augmented and Virtual Reality applications written in JavaScript and
        rendered
        with WebGL. It provides
        implementations for WebGL, WebVR, WebAudio, Gamepad APIs, Canvas, XmlHttpRequest, Image such that existing
        WebGL web apps run in HoloJs with little to no modifications.

        <div class="note">
            <span class="bold">Note: </span>HoloJs implements a minimal DOM, just enough to fully implement WebGL.
            Most
            DOM operations, like creating elements, CSS, etc. will fail. DOM support is restricted to the following
            elements: window, canvas, image.
        </div>

        HoloJs extends the web standards with interfaces that abstract the underlying hardware and make it easier to
        create experiences for various form factors and headsets:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">CanvasVR </span>represents the rendering surface of the currently attached
                device. An
                attached device can be a HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality headset, or in the absence of these a 2D
                desktop window. The script application does not need to manage this canvas element.
                Obtaining a CanvasVR element is done through the standard document.createElement(...). </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Spatial Mapping.</span> HoloLens only. To be documented.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Voice commands.</span> To be documented.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Spatial anchors.</span> Currently HoloLens only. To be documented.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to use HoloJs</h3>
        Depending on goals, HoloJs can be used in a variety of ways:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Build from scratch </span>and embedd in your C++ project. This approach is
                suitable
                if the existing HoloJs implementation does not meet
                requirements and modifying the underlying C++ code can achieve your goals. An example would be
                adding
                support for additional headsets (Oculus, HTC Vive, etc.), platforms (Android, Linux, etc.) or
                exposing
                more platform features to the script app.<br>
                Clone the code from <a
                    href="https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloJS">https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloJS</a> and follow
                the
                build instructions
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Use the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/holojs/"> HoloJs Nuget
                        package</a></span> in your C++ code. This approach is suitable if you want to create a
                standalone JavaScript AR/VR that you can publish as a Win32 or UWP app.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Use <a href="spin-make.html">Spin </a></span> to
                create AR and VR experiences in minutes that others can view using the
                <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NXBC7673V0S">Spin View app for Windows and HoloLens.</a> This method is suitable
                if your experience does not require any additional
                platform capabilities beyond those already provided by HoloJs. This method does not require C++
                knowledge; all coding is done in JavaScript/Visual Studio Code and no compilation is required.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Under the hood</h3>
        Internally, HoloJs uses a variety of open source components to create the hosting environment:
        <ul>
                <li><a class="bold" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore">ChakraCore</a> provides the JavaScript runtime.</li>
                <li><a class="bold" href="https://github.com/google/angle">ANGLE</a> provides the WebGL implementation for the Win32 platform.</li>
                <li><a class="bold" href="https://github.com/microsoft/angle">Microsoft ANGLE</a> provides the WebGL implementation for the UWP and HoloLens platform.</li>
                <li><a class="bold" href="https://github.com/LabSound/LabSound">LabSound</a> provides the WebAudio implementation, including spatial audio rendering.</li>
                <li><a class="bold" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore-Debugger">ChakraCore debugger</a> provides the debugger protocol implementation that enables editing and debugging HoloJs apps using Visual Studio Code.</li>
                <li><a class="bold" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D">Win2D</a> provides the implementation for canvas's 2D context on the Windows platform.</li>
                <li><a class="bold" href="https://bitbucket.org/wbenny/ziplib">ZipLib</a> provides cross platform archive decompression.</li>
                
        </ul>
